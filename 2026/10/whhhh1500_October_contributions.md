# whhhh1500's October Contributions

A summary of security contributions by whhhh1500 in October 2026:

* Reported an authenticated host-abort defect in `tari-ootle`'s `tari_walletd`, submitted through GitHub Security Advisories and tracked in `GHSA-hfr4-p7mh-c6wc`.
* The report showed that `TransferStatementRequest::total_output_amount` (and the parallel SDK helpers) sum caller-controlled `Amount` / `u64` fields with the panicking `Amount` `Add`/`Sum` operators, so a small authenticated `accounts.create_stealth_transfer_statement` request whose revealed amounts overflow `u128` aborts the whole wallet daemon (`panic = "abort"` plus a global hook that calls `process::exit(1)`).
* Provided root-cause analysis across the handler and SDK sum sites, a runnable arithmetic proof of concept with measured impact, and a suggested checked-add fix. Testing was performed locally only; no shared network was touched.
* The fix was implemented by the Tari team in `tari-ootle#2939`. The contribution is tracked in `tari-project/special_contributions#199`.
